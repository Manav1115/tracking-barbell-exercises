# Tracking Barbell Exercises

This repository provides all the code to process, visualize, and classify accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from [Mbientlab's WristBand Sensor Research Kit](https://mbientlab.com/). The data was collected during gym workouts where participants were performing various barbell exercises.

#### Exercises

#### Goals
* Classify barbell exercises
* Count repetitions
* Detect improper form
